Part, fools!
Have at thee, coward!
Clubs, bills, and partisans!
Give me my long sword, ho!
A crutch, a crutch!
My sword, I say!
What, ho!
Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Why then, O brawling love!
O anything, of nothing first create!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
What, lamb!
What, Juliet!
But, as I said,
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse!
A man, young lady!
Nay, bigger!
Come, we burn daylight, ho!
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
On, lusty gentlemen!
Anthony, and Potpan!
Cheerly, boys!
Welcome, gentlemen!
Ah ha, my mistresses!
Welcome, gentlemen!
Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
You are welcome, gentlemen!
A hall, a hall!
More light, you knaves!
Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
Tis more, 'tis more!
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
Forswear it, sight!
Go to, go to!
Well said, my hearts!
More light, more light!
Cheerly, my hearts!
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
My only love, sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Anon, anon!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!
O, speak again, bright angel!
O Romeo, Romeo!
O, be some other name!
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords!
Sweet, good night!
Good night, good night!
Dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse!
O blessed, blessed night!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
Romeo, hist!
Good night, good night!
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
O, let us hence!
Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
Ah, the
    immortal passado!
By Jesu, a very good blade!
O, their bones, their bones!
O flesh, flesh, how
    art thou fishified!
Signior Romeo, bon jour!
Come between us, good Benvolio!
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs!
Nay, good goose, bite not!
O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    narrow to an ell broad!
Stop there, stop there!
O, thou art deceiv'd!
A sail, a sail!
Two, two!
Very well took, i' faith!
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!
Marry, farewell!
And thou must
    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
Lord,
    Lord!
Lord, Lord!
Ah, mocker!
O, she is lame!
O God, she comes!
Fie, how my bones ache!
Jesu, what haste!
Lord, how my head aches!
Amen, amen!
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
    says 'God send me no need of thee!
Zounds, consort!
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Come, sir, your passado!
Gentlemen, for shame!
Hold, Tybalt!
Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death!
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
Romeo, away, be gone!
Hence, be gone, away!
O, I am fortune's fool!
Tybalt, my cousin!
O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my dear kinsman!
O cousin, cousin!
Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends!
Ah, weraday!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
O Romeo, Romeo!
O, break, my heart!
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
It did, it did!
O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
I would forget it fain;
    But O, it presses to my memory
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
I'll to my wedding bed;
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
O, find him!
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    Howling attends it!
Hark, how they knock!
I come, I come!
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!
Stand up, stand up!
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
What, rouse thee, man!
O, what learning is!
But, soft!
Light to my chamber, ho!
Come, death, and welcome!
It is, it is!
Hie hence, be gone, away!
O, now be gone!
Farewell, farewell!
O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
Adieu, adieu!
O Fortune, Fortune!
Ho, daughter!
O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
Madam, in happy time!
Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
I out, you baggage!
Fie, fie!
Hang thee, young baggage!
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
Out on her, hilding!
Smatter with your gossips, go!
Peace, you mumbling fool!
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Go, counsellor!
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
O, shut the door!
Give me, give me!
O, tell not me of fear!
Pardon, I beseech you!
What, ho!
No, No!
O, look!
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come!
Come, stir, stir, stir!
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
What, ho!
What, nurse, I say!
Hie, make haste,
    Make haste!
Why, lamb!
Why, love, I say!
Why, bride!
Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
Alas, alas!
Help, help!
Look, look!
O me, O me!
My child, my only life!
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help!
She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead!
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Dead art thou, dead!
Peace, ho, for shame!
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
O, I cry you mercy!
Hang him, Jack!
Then I defy you, stars!
O mischief, thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
What, ho!
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
O, be gone!
Then have at thee, boy!
O Lord, they fight!
O, I am slain!
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
O, give me thy hand,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace!
O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
O, pale!
Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
Capulet, Montage,
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
